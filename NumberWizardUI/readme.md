NumberWizardUI by Josh Stevens, 2015

This project is based on the "Learn to Code by Making Games" course by Ben Tristem and 
Brice Fernandes.

The game is a number guessing game in which the user selects a number in their head,
and the computer generates a random guess. Then, based on the user input (Higher, Lower,
or Correct), the computer does a binary chop of the original range of numbers and then
guesses again. The computer has a limited number of guesses. Most of the time, however,
the computer should be able to win, because the number of guesses is tuned to be just
enough for the algorithm to be successful most of the time.

The true purpose of this version (which uses the core logic of the NumberWizard console
project) is to become familiar with Unity3D UI elements and Unity3D scene handling.

Best part? The LevelManager script created for this can be reused in all future Unity3D
projects to handle scene changes.
